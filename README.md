# 🏡 Airbnb Data Analysis

📊 Project Overview This project analyzes the Airbnb dataset using Python libraries in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The goal is to explore and uncover insights into listing prices, room types, neighborhood trends, and user reviews. The dataset provides real-world data to apply data analysis, visualization, and interpretation skills.

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3

- Jupyter Notebook

- Pandas – for data manipulation

- NumPy – for numerical operations

- Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

📁 Dataset

The dataset used is sourced from Airbnb listings and includes information such as:

- Listing prices

- Room types

- Neighborhoods

- Review counts and dates

- Availability and other attributes

📈 Key Insights

- Distribution of Listing Prices: Most listings are priced moderately, with some high-priced outliers; median price offers a better central measure due to skewed data.

- Room Type Distribution: Entire homes/apartments dominate the listings, followed by private rooms, with shared rooms being rare.

- Neighborhood Types: Listings are concentrated in popular and central neighborhoods, which generally show higher average prices.

- Relationship Between Price and Room Type: Entire homes command the highest prices, private rooms offer affordability, and shared rooms are least expensive.

- Reviews Over Time: Reviews have increased steadily, showing seasonal trends and indicating growing platform engagement.
